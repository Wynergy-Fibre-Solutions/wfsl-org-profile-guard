## Governance alignment

WFSL Org Profile Guard operates under the authority of the
WFSL Control and Execution Governance Charter.

The charter defines the non-negotiable principles governing authority,
deny-by-default posture, organisational surface exposure, and control
boundaries across WFSL systems.

This project implements organisational and profile-level controls that are
justified by, and subordinate to, that charter.
